# Django-Stock-Market

This is a simple Web application using Django (A python Based Database Framework) to fetch Stocks data From IEXcloud.io for the given ticker.

This site can be used to add stocks according to their symbol, see financial status, remove stocks in case we do not want to see them.

I added a cool widget to this site called: Advanced Real-Time Chart Widget, the credit goes to the site: https://in.tradingview.com/widget/

This allows us to actually sketch the graph and see financial data about the company we are looking for, just like real traders.

Another widget that is linked to all the pages on the site is called: Ticker Tape Widget.

It gives a Wall Street feel by showing stocks running on the screen (stocks I chose to show, of course the Tel Aviv 35 index appears there because I am from Israel).

This project was experimental and I may return to it and change some things in the future.
